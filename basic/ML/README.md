# ML

- machine learning - This the art of data preparation, model buikding, evauation, optimizarion and Prediction on new data

## regression 

- Difference( classification and regression task)

- Simple linear regression
- Multiple linear regression
- Polynomial regeression
- Regularization technique
    - Ridge regression, 
    - lasso regression
- Support vector regression
- Decision tree regression
- Random Forest reression
- Model evaluation metrics for regession
    - Measn Absolute error
    - Mean Squared error 
    - Root mean Squared Error
    - R-squared and Adjusted R-squared 
- Model selction and hyper paremeter tunning
    - split dataset-training, validation and test sets
    - cross validation
    - grid search and randomized search for hyperparameter tuning
    - Implement model selection and hyperparamenter tuning


In the model building we use a package library called scikit-learn(data mining and data analysis)
